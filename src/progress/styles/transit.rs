//! Transit / Transportation progress bars — the **transit** theme.
//!
//! Twelve structurally distinct bars built around trains, planes, boats, and
//! mass-transit systems.  Every style uses a different spatial layout, temporal
//! mechanic, and geometric primitive — color never separates two styles here.
//!
//! # Style catalogue
//!
//! | name | mechanic |
//! |---|---|
//! | `steam-train`       | Locomotive + cars slide right; wheels rotate + smoke puffs rise |
//! | `airplane-takeoff`  | Plane taxis along a runway then climbs on a curved ascent |
//! | `sailboat-tacking`  | Hull + sail zigzag across the bar; heading flips at walls |
//! | `subway-map`        | Station dots along a route line; train marker advances between them |
//! | `hot-air-balloon`   | Envelope + basket rises; flame bursts pulse from basket |
//! | `ferris-wheel`      | Cabins orbit a rimmed wheel that spins driven by time |
//! | `cable-car`         | Gondola climbs a diagonal cable; support towers mark intervals |
//! | `escalator`         | Steps slide diagonally upward in a loop driven by time |
//! | `rocket-gantry`     | Countdown fills the frame; gantry arms retract then liftoff plume |
//! | `ferry-crossing`    | Ferry hull crosses with a V-shaped wake spreading behind |
//! | `bicycle`           | Two spinning wheels advance; pedal crank rotates between them |
//! | `helicopter`        | Rotor blades spin above a fuselage; body rises as progress grows |
