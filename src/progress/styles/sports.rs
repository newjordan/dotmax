//! Sports-themed progress bars — eleven distinct athletic spectacles in braille dots.
//!
//! Every bar is stateless: all motion comes from `ctx.time` (perpetual animation)
//! and `ctx.eased` / `ctx.progress` (progress-driven advancement). All writes go
//! through `draw::` helpers so every pixel is silently bounds-safe.
//!
//! Styles in this file:
//! - `sprint-100m`      — runner advances right, legs cycle, finish tape snaps at 100%
//! - `basketball-arc`   — ball traces a parabola into a hoop, swish flash at 100%
//! - `soccer-goal`      — ball curves into a net, net bulges on score
//! - `swimming-laps`    — swimmer bobs across a lane, lap counter via vblocks
//! - `archery`          — bow draws back with eased, arrow flies to a bullseye
//! - `bowling`          — ball rolls down lane, pins topple progressively at end
//! - `darts`            — dart flies toward concentric scoring rings of a dartboard
//! - `high-jump`        — athlete arcs over a bar that rises with progress
//! - `weightlifting`    — barbell overhead, plate stack height = eased
//! - `tennis-rally`     — ball bounces between baselines, rally count as hbar fills
//! - `cycling-peloton`  — wheels spin, riders packed tight, gap eaten by progress
