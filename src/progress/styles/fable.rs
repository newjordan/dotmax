//! Fable progress bars — quiet, storybook motion in indigo, gold and moonlight.
//!
//! Twelve small scenes, each with its own mechanic: ink blooming in water,
//! lanterns in procession, moths spiralling to a flame, a constellation being
//! woven, fireflies over a meadow, a quill stroke, paper folding open, a
//! phosphor tide, meshing clockwork, a murmuration, a sideways hourglass and
//! a river carrying light. Every scene is deterministic in `(progress, time)`
//! and loops seamlessly at 4 s (all rates are multiples of 0.25 Hz).
