## What Went Well

### Exceptional Performance
- `swap_buffers()` achieved ~2.4ns execution time (450,000x faster than 1ms target)
- Differential rendering achieved 60-95% I/O reduction for typical animations
- All performance targets exceeded

### Clean Architecture
Animation module established with 5 cohesive, well-integrated components:
- `FrameBuffer` - Double buffering for flicker-free rendering
- `FrameTimer` - Precise frame rate control (30fps, 60fps, custom)
- `AnimationLoop` - High-level builder-pattern API
- `PrerenderedAnimation` - Frame caching with file serialization
- `DifferentialRenderer` - CPU-optimized rendering

### Comprehensive Documentation
- 5 animation examples created (bouncing_ball, loading_spinner, waveform, fireworks, clock)
- `animation_guide.md` tutorial covering all animation concepts
- README updated with Animation section
- All public APIs have rustdoc with working examples

### Smooth Execution
- No blockers encountered
- All 6 stories completed without issues
- Consistent quality across all deliverables

---

## What Could Be Improved

No significant issues identified. Epic 6 was a straightforward implementation sprint.

---

## Patterns That Worked

1. **Builder Pattern** - AnimationLoop's fluent API made animation creation simple
2. **Infallible Constructors** - FPS clamping (1-240) instead of errors for better ergonomics
3. **Guard Pattern** - Terminal cleanup on all exit paths
4. **Consistent Rustdoc** - Examples for all public methods, verified via doc tests

---

## Technical Debt

None incurred during Epic 6.

---

## Key Insights

1. Simple, focused stories with clear acceptance criteria lead to smooth delivery
2. Animation APIs benefit from builder patterns - reduces boilerplate for users
3. Performance optimization (differential rendering) was straightforward with clean architecture

---

## Action Items

None required - clean epic with no follow-up work needed.

---

## Next Epic Preview

**Epic 7: API Design, Performance & Production Readiness**
- Public API surface design
- Comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Hot path optimization
- Test suite completion
- Documentation finalization
- crates.io publication

---

## User Feedback

> "Animations are simple, show basic elements, not much to critique, and they worked great."
> — Frosty (Project Lead)

## Retrospective Status

**Outcome:** Clean epic, no issues, ready for Epic 7
